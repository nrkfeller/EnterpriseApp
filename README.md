==============

Simple generic enterprise software
----------------------------------

### Welcome to the Repo

there us the deployment on Heroku[Enterprise App](https://enterpriseapplicationexample.herokuapp.com/companies)

> ## What is this?
> A simple example of an application that can be built for a company's internal purposes, for keeping track of transaction, payroll, employee history etc.
> ** I purposely remove the autherication requirement to view the information so you dont have to actually sign up and validate your email to view the content. But that can be reinstated with an if statement in the 'application.html.erb' file
